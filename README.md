### :wave: Hello to Everyone! :wave:
###  <h3> I'm Alexis Mata and I'm a Developer </h3>

I am passionate about developing and coding, as well as growing in knowledge when it comes to technological tools. 

I am located in Venezuela, and currently developing a software solution based on the Laravel Framework (from 6.x to 8.x), using several dependencies for its creation, as well as Laravel Livewire, Laravel UI Bootstrap, Laravel Permissions, etc. As well as using Microsoft SQL Server as the robust database manager. 

However I have worked with MySql on personal projects and exercises. As well as I have been able to work a little with WordPress for the creation of Web Sites.

I can say about me, that I have been studying in a self-taught way other tools like Angular, Ionic, Vue.Js.
